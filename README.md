#**🌦️ Weather App (Open-Meteo API)**

🌤️ Simple Weather App**

A **Java desktop application** with a modern Swing GUI that fetches and displays the current temperature (in Celsius) and weather description for any city using the [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/).  
The app features robust error handling, supports Unicode city names, allows for simulated API failures, and logs responses to a file for easy debugging.


Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
